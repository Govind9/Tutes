	To get the latest stuff from a repo:
		git fetch nickname branch
	To merge these fetched stuff to your local repo:
		git merge nickname branch
	To do the above two things in one step use:
		git pull nickname branch
	
To get a working of an entire repo and start working on it directly without having to do all the linking stuff do:
	git clone https://github.com/username/Hello-World.git
	
To know which remote repo your local repo is connected to:
	git remote -v
